A fully functional React calendar component with a minimalist design. This component allows users to navigate between months, view days of the week, and select specific dates. It's styled using TailwindCSS and leverages the **date-fns** library for date manipulation.

## Features

- Navigate between months.
- Highlights the current day.
- Marks weekends with a distinct style.
- Fully keyboard-accessible (supports `Enter` and `Space` for selection).
- Customizable and reusable.

};
```

#### 3. Add Tailwind directives to your CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
